Unofficial Palette API PoC Tester

This android app contains functions of Palette Unofficial API.
API version is 1 (Adorable Chihaya), and it supports reading and writing tweet status currently logged into Palette for Android.

Currently, tweet cannot be written or read from API when Palette for Twitter is not active because of limitation of Palette for Android, but this feature is planned to be implemented in the future.

This testing app requires 'Palette Plugin Support' application to communicate with Palette for Android. You can find this application in the Google Play Store.
